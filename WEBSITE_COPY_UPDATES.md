## 🎤 About Page Updates

### Mission Statement
```
## Our Mission: Amplifying Human Creativity

We believe AI should enhance human creativity, not replace it. 
CodedSwitch was born from the idea that the best creative tools 
are collaborative partners, not automated replacements.

Every feature we build asks: "How can this make humans more creative?"
```

### The Story
```
## Where It All Started

CodedSwitch began with a simple observation: 
the most creative people often have both technical and artistic minds.

Developers who dream in melodies.
Musicians who think in algorithms.
Artists who see beauty in clean code.

We built CodedSwitch for the whole person - 
not just the developer OR the musician, 
but the creative technologist who is both.
```

### Values
```
🤝 Collaboration Over Automation
AI works WITH you, not FOR you

🎨 Creativity Over Efficiency  
The journey matters as much as the destination

🌍 Community Over Competition
We rise by lifting each other

🔧 Simplicity Over Complexity
Powerful tools should feel intuitive
